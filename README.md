# WeatherCheckIns
Node.js application that allows user to check in their location along with the weather.
Built using Node.js, Express and NeDB. Data about weather is fetched from OpenWeatherMap.

In order for the project to work you need to specify your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
1. Change the name of ".env_toChange" file to ".env".
2. Modify the file: insert your API key in the appropriate place.

The project is based on Daniel Shiffman's (The Coding Train) tutorials regarding Node.js and dealing with APIs, that can be found on YouTube. My take on the project has been expanded by some additional functions.
